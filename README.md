Meals App
Overview
This Android project is a Meals app built using the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture, Kotlin programming language, and various Jetpack libraries. It allows users to explore different meal categories, view details of each category, and explore individual meals within those categories.

Screens
The app consists of the following screens:

Home Page: Contains different sections showcasing various meal categories. Each section in the data object is mapped to corresponding UI components.
Category Detail Screen: When the user clicks on a category item from the home page, the category detail page opens, displaying more information about the selected category.
Meal Detail Screen: When the user clicks on a meal item on the category detail screen, it opens the meal detail page, providing detailed information about the selected meal.
Features
MVI architecture: Provides a robust and scalable app structure.
Multi-Module Setup: Organizes code for better maintainability.
Clean Architecture Principles: Promotes separation of concerns and easier testing and debugging.
Jetpack Compose: Modern UI toolkit for Android.
Jetpack Navigation: Navigation component for managing navigation within Android apps.
Jetpack ViewModel: Architecture component for managing UI-related data.
Coroutines and Flow: Used for asynchronous programming, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
Dagger Hilt: Dependency injection library.
Room Database: Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
Coil: An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
Unit Testing: Ensures code quality and app reliability.
Jetpack UI Testing: Automated UI testing framework for Android.
Jetpack Compose UI Test: UI testing library specifically for Jetpack Compose.
Code Coverage
Kotlin 100% Coverage: Aim for 100% test coverage of Kotlin code to ensure comprehensive testing and reliability.
