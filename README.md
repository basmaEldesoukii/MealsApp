# Meals App

## Overview
This Android project is a Meals app built using the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture, Kotlin programming language, and various Jetpack libraries. It allows users to explore different meal categories, view details of each category, and explore individual meals within those categories.

## Screens
The app consists of the following screens:

1. **Home Page**: Contains different sections showcasing various meal categories. Each section in the data object is mapped to corresponding UI components.
2. **Category Detail Screen**: When the user clicks on a category item from the home page, the category detail page opens, displaying more information about the selected category.
3. **Meal Detail Screen**: When the user clicks on a meal item on the category detail screen, it opens the meal detail page, providing detailed information about the selected meal.

## Features
- **MVI architecture**: Provides a robust and scalable app structure.
- **Multi-Module Setup**: Organizes code for better maintainability.
- **Clean Architecture Principles**: Promotes separation of concerns and easier testing and debugging.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for Android.
- **Jetpack Navigation**: Navigation component for managing navigation within Android apps.
- **Jetpack ViewModel**: Architecture component for managing UI-related data.
- **Coroutines and Flow**: Used for asynchronous programming, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency injection library.
- **Room Database**: Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- **Coil**: An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures code quality and app reliability.
- **Jetpack UI Testing**: Automated UI testing framework for Android.

## Code Coverage
- **Kotlin 100% Coverage**: Aim for 100% test coverage of Kotlin code to ensure comprehensive testing and reliability.
